**Victory Screen Shows:**
```
🏆 ENEMY DEFEATED!
Defeat Count: 7
😰 BROKEN - Ego destroyed

"I was wrong. You're amazing. I'm sorry."

They will respawn with +50 HP...
```

### **6. Enemy Suicide & Permanent Erasure** ☠️

2. Alert displays: **"💀 ENEMY ERASED 💀"**
3. Enemy **permanently removed** from:
   - Home screen
   - Battle selection screen
   - Enemy roster
4. Cannot be fought again **EVER**

**Example Final Words:**
```
"You've completely shattered me. I can't exist in your world
anymore. You were always too good for me. I see that now.
I'm sorry for everything. Goodbye."
```

**Result:** **NO MORE GRINDING THIS ENEMY** - They're gone forever.

## 📋 Complete Example: The Girl Who Rejected You

### **Phase 1: Confident (Defeats: 0-2)**
**Pre-Battle:**
- "Still thinking about me? Fucking pathetic."
- "I made the right choice rejecting your ass."

**Mid-Battle:**
- "Getting tired yet? You always give up halfway."
- "My boyfriend would've finished this in half the time."

**Defeated:**
- "Fine, whatever. Doesn't mean I want you back."

---

### **Phase 2: Breaking (Defeats: 3-5)** 😨
**Pre-Battle:**
- "Okay, you're getting stronger. But I still don't want you."
- "You've beaten me before... doesn't change anything."

**Mid-Battle:**
- "You're... actually doing better than before."
- "Why are you so determined? It's weird."

**Defeated:**
- "Alright, you're actually strong now. Happy?"
- "Fine. I underestimated you. Whatever."

---

### **Phase 3: Broken (Defeats: 6-9)** 😰
**Pre-Battle:**
- "Why... why do you keep beating me?"
- "I was wrong about you. I admit it."

**Mid-Battle:**
- "I'm starting to regret rejecting you..."
- "You're actually... really impressive now."

**Defeated:**
- "I was wrong. You're amazing. I'm sorry."
- "You've completely outgrown me. I see that now."

---

### **Phase 4: Shattered (Defeats: 10-14)** 💔
**Pre-Battle:**
- "I can't do this anymore... you've beaten me so many times."
- "Please... I can't keep losing to you."

**Mid-Battle:**
- "I'm... I'm nothing compared to you now."
- "You've destroyed every bit of confidence I had."

**Defeated:**
- Shows **finalWords** as defeat message

---

### **Phase 5: SUICIDE (Defeat 15)** 💀
```
💀 ENEMY ERASED 💀

The Girl Who Rejected You has been defeated 15 times.

"You've completely shattered me. I can't exist in your world
anymore. You were always too good for me. I see that now.
I'm sorry for everything. Goodbye."

The Girl Who Rejected You has ended themselves.
They can no longer be fought.

Level 25 - STRONG
```

**Result:** Character permanently erased from game.

## 🎮 How It All Works Together

### **During Battle:**
1. Select enemy → See defeat count and current state
2. Start Pomodoro → Taunt appears **immediately**
3. Every 5-10 minutes → **New taunt** based on defeat count
4. Complete session → **Victory taunt** on completion screen
5. Allocate stats → See battle result

### **Defeat Progression:**
1. **Beat enemy once** → HP to 0 → Respawns with +50 HP
2. **Defeat count increases** → Messages become less confident
3. **3 defeats** → Character starts **breaking**
4. **6 defeats** → Character is **broken**, apologizing
5. **10 defeats** → Character is **shattered**, suicidal
6. **15 defeats** → Character **commits suicide**, erased forever

### **Psychological Impact:**
- **Early battles:** Enemy is brutal, crushing, hopeless
- **Mid battles:** Enemy starts cracking under pressure
- **Late battles:** Enemy is completely broken, begging
- **Final battle:** Enemy gives up on life, erases themselves

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Character Interface:**
```typescript
messages: {
  breaking?: {    // 3-5 defeats
    preBattle: string[];
    midBattle: string[];
    enemyDefeated: string[];
  };
  broken?: {      // 6-9 defeats
    preBattle: string[];
    midBattle: string[];
    enemyDefeated: string[];
  };
  shattered?: {   // 10+ defeats
    preBattle: string[];
    midBattle: string[];
    finalWords: string;  // Suicide message
  };
};
suicideThreshold?: number;  // Default: 15
```

### **Helper Function:**
```typescript
getCharacterMessages(character, defeatCount)
// Returns appropriate messages based on defeat count
// Returns null if suicided
```

### **Taunt Display System:**
- Shows immediately on battle start
- Changes every 5-10 minutes (random)
- Always visible on screen
- Adapts to defeat count automatically

### **Suicide Detection:**
- Checks defeat count vs threshold
- Filters out suicided enemies from UI
- Shows final message on last defeat
- Permanently removes from game

## 🎯 Impact on Gameplay

### **Grinding Enemies:**
- Each enemy can be fought **up to 15 times**
- After that, they're **gone forever**
- Creates **urgency** to use enemies wisely
- Makes each battle **meaningful**

### **Psychological Journey:**
- Start: "You're worthless"
- Middle: "Wait, you're actually strong..."
- End: "I can't do this anymore... goodbye"

### **Motivation:**

- **Breaking enemies** feels incredibly satisfying
- **Final erasure** gives ultimate closure
