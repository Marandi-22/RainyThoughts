### 4. **AI Personality Updates**

Updated AI generation prompts for all demon personalities:

**toxic_manipulator:**
```
Be BRUTAL. Use profanity freely (fuck, shit, ass, damn, etc).
Quote their journal entries directly. Be cutting, cruel, and personal.
Reference their failures, insecurities, and embarrassments.
Mock them relentlessly. This is psychological warfare - make it HURT.
```

**dark_demon:**
```
You ARE their inner voice of self-doubt and self-hatred. Be VICIOUS.
Use profanity. Tell them they're worthless, that they'll fail,
that nothing matters. You're the voice that says "just give up,
you piece of shit". Be insidious, crushing, brutal.
```

**chaos_agent:**
```
Find their suffering absolutely HILARIOUS. Be theatrical and unhinged.
Use profanity for emphasis. Mock their desperate attempts at productivity.
Laugh at their pathetic little schedules.
```

**cold_villain:**
```
You're ancient, powerful, and utterly dismissive. Their pathetic
struggles bore you. Be condescending and brutal. Their productivity
goals are laughably insignificant.
```

## 📋 How It Works Now

### **During Battle:**
1. **Pre-Battle** - Brutal taunt before starting
2. **Mid-Battle** (every 5 minutes) - Taunts appear as bubbles during work
3. **Victory** - Demon reluctantly acknowledges your success
4. **Defeat** - Demon mocks you brutally for quitting
5. **Enemy Defeated** (HP = 0) - Demon admits defeat in character

### **Example Flow:**

```
1. Select "The Girl Who Rejected You" (HP: 100/100)
2. Pre-Battle: "Still thinking about me? Fucking pathetic."
3. Start 25-min Pomodoro
4. [5 minutes] Mid-taunt: "Getting tired yet? You always give up halfway."
5. [10 minutes] Mid-taunt: "My boyfriend would've finished this in half the time."
6. Complete session, deal 27 damage (HP: 73/100)
7. Victory: "One productive day doesn't unfuck your entire life."

... (several sessions later)

8. Deal final 15 damage (HP: 0/100)
9. ENEMY DEFEATED!
10. Defeat message: "Fine, whatever. Doesn't mean I want you back."
11. Enemy respawns with 150 HP
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Character Interface Updated:
```typescript
messages: {
  preBattle: string[];        // Before session
  victory: string[];          // Complete session
  defeat: string[];           // Quit/fail session
  midBattle?: string[];       // NEW: Mid-session taunts
  enemyDefeated?: string[];   // NEW: When HP = 0
}
```

### Mid-Battle Taunt System:
- Interval: Every 5 minutes
- Display: 5 seconds as bubble
- Priority: Uses `midBattle` messages if available, falls back to AI-generated
- Pauses when timer is paused

### Enemy Defeat Messages:
- Triggers when HP reaches exactly 0
- Displayed in victory alert
- Chosen randomly from `enemyDefeated` array
- Falls back to generic message if not defined

## 🎯 Remaining Characters

**Note:** Currently updated 3 demons with full brutal messages. Remaining 14 demons will use:
- Existing messages (some already brutal)
- AI-generated taunts (now configured for profanity)
- Generic defeat message: "Damn... you actually won. I'll be back."

You can update remaining demons with custom midBattle and enemyDefeated messages following the same pattern.
