# ✅ Changes Made - Quest System & Mentor/Demon Split

## 🎯 Major Changes

### 1. Character System Overhaul

**Before:** All characters used "taunts" (negative motivation)

**Now:**
- **3 Mentors** (Goggins, Peterson, Naval) - `category: 'mentor'`
  - Use supportive, encouraging messages
  - Help you succeed with positive reinforcement
  - Personalities: supportive_mentor, wise_mentor, strategic_mentor

- **17 Demons** - `category: 'demon'`
  - Use taunts and psychological warfare
  - Personal demons, inner demons, chaos agents, dark lords
  - Stay as challenging opponents

**All characters now use `messages` instead of `taunts`**

### 2. Quest System (BRAND NEW!)

**File:** `constants/questSystem.ts`

**Features:**
- Create quests in 4 categories: Wealth, Strength, Wisdom, Luck
- Each quest automatically awards points to its category
- No need to manually allocate quest points
- Quest examples provided for each category
- Track active and completed quests

**Quest Categories:**
- 💰 **Wealth** - Business, career, money tasks
- 💪 **Strength** - Exercise, health, discipline
- 🧠 **Wisdom** - Learning, studying, skills
- 🍀 **Luck** - Networking, connections, opportunities

### 3. New Quests Tab

**File:** `app/(tabs)/quests.tsx`

**Features:**
- View quests by category
- Create new quests with templates
- Complete quests to earn points
- Quest examples for inspiration
- Beautiful category-color-coded UI

### 4. Updated Navigation

**4 Tabs Now:**
1. 🏠 Home - Stats & Characters
2. 📋 Quests - Quest management (NEW!)
3. ⚔️ Battle - Pomodoro timer
4. 📝 Journal - Journal entries

## 📋 How the New System Works

### Quest-Based Flow (Recommended)

1. **Create a Quest**
   - Go to Quests tab
   - Select category (Wealth/Strength/Wisdom/Luck)
   - Add quest title (e.g., "Complete client project")
   - Save quest

2. **Work on Quest**
   - Go to Battle tab
   - Choose mentor or demon
   - Work for 25 minutes

3. **Complete Quest**
   - Go back to Quests tab
   - Mark quest as complete
   - **Auto-earn +5 points in that quest's category!**
   - Points automatically added to correct stat

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Build Wealth**
- Create quest: "Finish freelance project" (Wealth category)
- Complete quest → Auto +5 Wealth points
- No manual allocation needed!

**Scenario 2: Get Stronger**
- Create quest: "Go to gym" (Strength category)
- Complete quest → Auto +5 Strength points
- Build your strength stat directly!

**Scenario 3: Balanced Growth**
- Create 1 quest in each category
- Complete them throughout the week
- Get balanced +5 in each stat
